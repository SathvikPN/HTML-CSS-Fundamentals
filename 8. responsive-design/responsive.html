            This is one of the rare times an inline style is acceptable, due to the fact that 
            it’s describing an innate property of the image. An image’s physical dimensions 
            are more content than presentation, so it makes sense for this to appear 
            in the HTML rather than the stylesheet.

<!--
    Our recommendation is to stick to the 1x and 2x version of srcset for images less than 600 pixels wide, 
    use the srcset plus sizes method from the previous section for bigger photos, and 
    reserve <picture> for when you’re trying to do something real fancy with your designer.
-->

<!--
    Summary:-
    Make images fit into mobile layouts while respecting their intrinsic size
Avoid making the user download unnecessarily large image files
We accomplished the former by making images always stretch to fill 100% of their 
container while limiting their size with an inline max-width style. For the latter, 
we used srcset to optimize for screen resolution, srcset plus sizes to optimize for 
device width, and finally the <picture> element for manual control over which image file is displayed.
