    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
    headings.</p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make the unordered list</p>
    <ul>
      <li>first item</li>
      <li>second item</li>
      <li>third item</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is how you make ordered list</p>
    <ol>
      <li>first item</li>
      <li>second item</li>
      <li>third item</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
      phrase.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
      of a word or phrase.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>
