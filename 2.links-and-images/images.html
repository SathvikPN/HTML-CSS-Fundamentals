    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for <a
      href='links.html'>links</a> and <a href='misc/extras.html'>useful
      extras</a>.

    <h2>JPGs</h2>
      <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>
      <img src='images/mochi.jpg' width="75" alt="mochi JPG" />

    <h2>GIFs</h2>
      <p>GIFs are good for animations.</p>
      <img src='images/mochi.gif' width="75" alt="mochi gif" />

      <h2>PNGs</h2>
        <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.</p>
        <img src='images/mochi.png' width="75" alt="mochi PNG" />

        <h2>SVGs</h2>
          <p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can.</p>
          <img src='images/mochi.svg' width="75" alt="mochi SVG" />
          <p>SVG is a vector-based graphics format,
            meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension
            without loss of quality.</p>

        <h3>Footnotes:</h3>
        <p>There is one potential issue with SVGs: for them to display
          consistently across browsers, you need to convert any text fields
          to outlines using your image editor (e.g., Abode Illustrator or Sketch).
          If your images contain a lot of text,
          this can have a big impact on file size.</p>

        <p>The width attribute sets an explicit dimension for the image.
          There’s a corresponding height attribute, as well.
          Setting only one of them will cause the image to scale proportionally,
          while defining both will stretch the image.
          Dimension values are specified in pixels, and
          you should never include a unit
          (e.g., width='75px' would be incorrect).
        <strong>but it’s usually better to set image dimensions with CSS
          so you can alter them with media queries.</strong> </p>
