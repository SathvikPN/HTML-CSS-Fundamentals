   <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
   <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
   should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
   <hr>
   <p>Entities always begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).
     In between, you put a special code that your browser
     will interpret as a symbol. In this case, it interprets lt, gt, and amp as
     less-than, greater-than, and ampersand symbols, respectively. <br>
     Visit <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref">here</a> for ton
     of such HTML entities.</p>
